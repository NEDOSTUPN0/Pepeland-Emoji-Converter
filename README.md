# Pepeland-Emoji-Converter
This small script allows you to convert the code from the `default.json` file in the Pepeland server resource pack into a config for the EmojiType mod.

How does it work?

First, you need to clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/NEDOSTUPN0/Pepeland-Emoji-Converter`

After that, you download the original Pepeland resourcepack from the official site, in it you go to the path `assets/minecraft/font` and copy the default.json file into the folder with the script. https://pepeland.net/wiki/game/resourcepack

Now you can just run the script, and in the same folder will appear the file `emojitype.json`, which should be copied to the folder .minecraft/config/
and then copy the resourcepack to the `.minecraft/resourcepacks/` folder.

The "EmojiType" mod is required for the config to work. And also activate the resourcepack itself in the minecraft settings 

You can also download a ready-made config that works with the latest version of the resourcepack (1.7.0).

After all the work done, you can go into the game and write in the chat :EtoKomu: or any emoji from the resourcepack
