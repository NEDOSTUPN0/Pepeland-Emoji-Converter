# Pepeland-Emoji-Converter
## This small script allows you to convert the code from the default.json file in the Pepeland server resource pack into a config for the EmojiType mod.

### How does it work?

First, you need to clone the repository:
``` git clone https://github.com/NEDOSTUPN0/Pepeland-Emoji-Converter ```

After that you need to download the original Pepeland resourcepack from the official website and copy it to the folder with the script. https://pepeland.net/wiki/game/resourcepack

Now you can just run the script, and in the same folder will appear the file `emojitype.json`, which should be copied to the folder .minecraft/config/
and then copy the resourcepack to the `.minecraft/resourcepacks/` folder.

The [EmojiType](https://modrinth.com/mod/emoji-type) mod is required for the config to work. And also activate the resourcepack itself in the minecraft settings 

After all the work done, you can go into the game and write in the chat :EtoKomu: or any emoji from the resourcepack
